Highlight bias while reading a news article. 

## Download and Installation 
1. Download the extension by clicking on the 'green' download button in the top right corner and downloading the ZIP file. 
2. Open up your chrome browser and type in 'chrome://extensions' to navigate to the extensions page. 
3. Click on the "Load unpacked extension" button and select the main directory of the downloaded ZIP file. 
4. Ensure that the extension is enabled. 

## Usage  
1. For the first highlight you make on a webpage: 
   1. Select the text you wish to highlight 
   2. Click on the extension button in your browser (a small red highlighter)
   3. Click on the text that you selected and a small tooltip with highlighter color options will appear. Highlight the text as you see fit!
2. Other highlights: Highlight as you normally would. Select text, select the appropriate color and the information will be saved in our database.

## Notes 
1. Use the following hightlighting scheme to mark-up articles:
  1. Red = clearly biased text/opinionated text 
  2. Yellow = context on a topic that may be factual but has been conveniently chosen to surround a subject 
  3. Green = clearly factual/unbiased text. Essentially the reason the article was written. 

2. This extension currently does not support re-highlights and un-highlighting text (it screws up our database). While you are marking up articles, please make sure you don't accidentally highlight text that shouldn't be highlighted (or mark it up with the wrong color).

3. If the highlighting tool-tip is not disappearing, then clicking twice in an area away from text on the webpage should help make the tool-tip disappear.
